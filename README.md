#Project : Live Scene Describer for Blind peole

#Description :

This project is all about using advanced technology to help people who are visually impaired navigate their surroundings more independently. The main idea is to turn images from a camera or uploaded pictures into spoken descriptions, giving users detailed information about the objects and scenes in front of them. The goal is to empower visually impaired individuals to make informed decisions as they move around.

#Key Features:

#Image Processing with Computer Vision:

Utilizes OpenCV for image processing tasks, such as capturing images from a camera or uploading images from a file. This forms the basis for understanding the visual environment.
#Image-to-Text Transformation:

Harnesses the power of Hugging Face's Transformers library to perform image-to-text conversion. A pre-trained deep learning model (Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) generates textual descriptions of the scenes captured in the images.
#Text-to-Speech Conversion:

Employs the pyttsx3 library for converting the textual descriptions into speech. This feature allows the system to articulate detailed information about the scene to the user in a natural and understandable manner.
#Interactive Web Application:

Developed using Streamlit, the web application offers a user-friendly interface for both uploading images and capturing real-time scenes through a camera. The application ensures a seamless experience for visually impaired users.
#Real-time Audio Feedback:

The system provides real-time audio feedback, allowing users to receive immediate information about their surroundings. By clicking the "Speak" button, the user can hear a detailed description of the scene, enabling them to navigate safely.
Assistance for Independent Mobility:

Designed to assist visually impaired individuals in independently navigating their environment by providing crucial information about obstacles, objects, and the overall scene layout.
